          Welcome to <i>TAEHS Web/App Development</i>. If you are a student in the
          class, the first thing you need to do (and which we should have done
          in class) is set up your GitHub account.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you have a GitHub account, click “Log in to GitHub” below to
          proceed. Or you can click “Use anonymously” to play with the
          environment but you will not be able to save your work or submit
          assignments. (You can always log in later by clicking the
          <svg class="bi" fill="#000">
            <use xlink:href="/img/bootstrap-icons.svg#github" />
          </svg>
          at the top of the page.)
        </p>

        <div class="login-buttons">
          <button id="login" class="login-button">
            <svg class="bi" fill="#fff">
              <use xlink:href="/img/bootstrap-icons.svg#github" />
            </svg>
            <span>Log in to GitHub</span>
          </button>

          <button id="anonymous" class="login-button">
            <svg class="bi" fill="#fff">
              <use xlink:href="/img/bootstrap-icons.svg#person" />
            </svg>
            <span>Use anonymously</span>
          </button>
        </div>

        <p>
          If you don’t have a GitHub account yet, please create one and then log
          in here for further instructions.

          Congratulations! You have successfully connected this app to GitHub.
          However you are not yet a member of the GitHub organization for this
          class, something Mr. Seibel needs to set up for you.
        </p>

        <p>This is your GitHub profile URL:</p>

          Congratulations! You have successfully connected this app to GitHub.
          And it looks like you have an invitation to join the GitHub
          organization for this class. You need to accept that invitation before
          you can proceed. The invite should be sent to whatever email you used
          when you created your GitHub account.

          I see you are logged into GitHub and a member of the
          <i>taehs-webapp-dev</i> GitHub organization. However there seems to
          have been some problem finishing the setup for your account. Please
          let Mr. Seibel know.

          This is a tool for the <i>TAEHS Web/App Development</i> class at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School. It is intended to provide a simple environment for experimenting with Javascript without all the complexities of a full development environment such as ReplIt or Glitch which we may use later in the year.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is also designed to take advantage of the browser’s ability to run
          Javascript natively. It does not need access to a server to run code
          making in extremely responsive even if the Wifi is flaking out.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, under the covers it is saving work to a GitHub repository in
          a very simplified workflow that does not depend on immediately
          learning any git commands. Code written in this environment for each
          assignment is saved to a directory and branch specific to that
          assignment each time it is saved. Thus when the assignment is done, it
          is easy to go to GitHub and create a PR containing just the work on
          that assignment which can then be commented on and worked on further
          before it is turned in and merged to main.

        This is a simple environment for experimenting with Javascript. The
        panel on the left is a code editor where you can define functions and
        variables. The panel on the right is called a REPL, which is an acronym
        for Read, Eval, Print Loop. You can type Javascript expressions in the
        REPL and hit return and it will evaluate them and print the resulting
        value. If you are logged in, changes you make in the editor will be
        saved.
